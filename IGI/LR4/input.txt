Hello everyone! Welcome to today's meeting at 14:30. Let's start with Mary's presentation, shall we? She'll discuss the project's timeline. The meeting might end at 15:45:20. Don't forget to smile :-) and enjoy the process. Here's a fun fact: the sky is blue because of light scattering. Are you ready to dive in? I saw a smiley ;-)) on the board! Time management is key, so let's wrap up by 16:00. Great job, team! Some tasks are tricky, like the one Anna's handling. By the way, I love to play piano every evening. Let's schedule the next meeting soon, okay?
